Objective:To show the team DUI trends in the NFL

Background: There is an average of about 900,000 DUI’s per year in the United States with at least 2,000 resulting in fatal injuries. We have seen an increase of DUI cases within our professional sport team players with NFL players being among the top. So my team and I chose to investigate NFL DUI’s a little further. 

Dataset: We found a dataset that compiles all of the DUI charges that NFL players have received from the years 2000-2017. The dataset includes the players name, their team, their position, the case and its description, and the outcome of the case (i.e. time served, fine, etc). With the dataset being more qualitative, we did more research and composed a “severity” column that describes the severity of the case ranging from 1-5, 1 being accused of drunk driving to 5 resulting in a fatal crash or involving violent/drug related crimes.

Analysis: We created three graphs to represent our 3 questions:
Which team had the most/least DUI’s in the given year? (bar chart)
Which months within a year do we see more DUI cases? (line graph)
What was the average severity of charges in the given year? (gauge chart)

Results:

Bar Chart:  As you can see, there are some discrepancies between the years but there are a few teams that show up multiple times during the years provided with MIA, MIN, and DEN being some of the few. We also realized that 2006-2017 seemed to have more teams involved in DUI cases than the years prior which averaged about 5 or 6 teams being involved in DUI arrests per year.

Line Graph:  The line graph allowed us to see which months or parts of the year we see more DUI cases among NFL players. Starting in about 2007, we see a decline in arrests typically around August each year. Though, there is not a major difference among the months, one could conclude that it may be associated with the start of the NFL season which typically begins in September. With the slight decline in 2007, we could also conclude that it may be linked to the start of rideshare with Uber launching in 2009 and Lyft launching in 2012.

Gauge Chart:  The gauge chart displays the average severity from all of the teams involved in a DUI charge that year. Most years seem to read an average of or about 2 which we composed to mean that the charge suspect was either driving recklessly or their blood alcohol level was at least a 0.1.


Conclusion:  NFL DUI cases seem to be consistent with the nation’s cases however, their charges (severity based on arrest) may be more lenient.
