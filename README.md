Objective:
To show the team DUI trends in the NFL

Summary
 This data visualization focuses on yearly trend data for DUI arrests in the NFL. 

 The Data
We retrieved data from Kaggle. The data file was cleaned and converted into a json file. The data specifically looked at the DUI cases of NFL Players The data spans from 2000 to the end of 2017. 
 
Observation
While reviewing the NFL DUI csv file, there was little numerical data showing so we created a new column to point out the severity level for each case.  After creating the severity column, we decide to create specific charts that show the following:
 
Teams with the most cases per year(Bar Chart)
Team Severity Average per year(Gauge)
 Sum of cases by month for each year (Line Chart)

Outcome

We noticed at least 1-2 teams having the most cases each year.  
Between 2000-2017, we found a lot of discrepancies between teams charged for DUI and the months within the year with the most DUIs. Why are there discrepancies?
